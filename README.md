# gcr - Git Code Review

*by [Josh Dick][1]*

---

`gcr` shows all commits in a Git branch that haven't been merged upstream, as well as the files affected by those commits, then optionally performs an interactive diff.

I wrote `gcr` to help facilitate code reviews. It shows information you need to do a code review (a list of relevant changed files) before merging commits upstream.

Run `gcr -h` for help/usage information.

`gcr` is released under a Simplified BSD license.
